aws-meetup-example-cloudformation
=================================

These are the scripts I used for AWSNE Meetup to demonstrate the ease of using Amazon EC2 ndoes to develop a service which reads from a queue and performs a job. There's a bash script order.sh which describes the order in which to make the cloudformation commands. You'll need the AWSCLI tools to run these. If you run order.sh everytime you run one of the cloudformation commands, it should update the output with any inputs needed generated by the previous command. If you want more information about what I've done here, please email me. The slides are also here in a PDF.
